    "\n",
    "The A* pathfinding algorithm was developed by following the pseudocode provided in the lecture *\"Space Robotics Systems\"*, delivered by Prof. Antonio Genova and Dr. Edoardo Del Vecchio from the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Sapienza University of Rome. During the development process, I used **ChatGPT** by OpenAI and **GitHub Copilot** to help refine the implementation, improve the code structure, and add meaningful comments. These tools provided suggestions that I adapted to meet the specific requirements of this project. This acknowledgment ensures transparency and helps prevent concerns related to plagiarism.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `NODE` class is designed to represent a point in the grid, encapsulating all the necessary attributes and methods for implementing the A* pathfinding algorithm. Below, we describe the key components of the `NODE` class and their roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Attributes and Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `position`: Represents the coordinates of the node on the grid (e.g., `[x, y]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `g`: The **cost** from the starting node to the current node. It is initialized to infinity (`float('inf')`) to indicate that nodes start off as unexplored.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `h`: The **heuristic estimate** of the cost from the current node to the goal. This value guides the A* algorithm toward the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `f`: The **total cost**, computed as `f = g + h`. This value is used to prioritize nodes during the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `parent`: A reference to the **parent node** in the path, used for path reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comparison (`__lt__`)**:\n",
    "This method allows nodes to be compared based on their f value. It is crucial because we use heapq, a priority queue that requires comparison for efficient sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **String Representation (`__repr__`)**:\n",
    "This method defines how the node should be represented when printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Path Reconstruction (`reconstruct_path`)**:\n",
    "This static method is used to reconstruct the optimal path once the goal is reached. Starting from the goal node, it traces back through each node’s parent attribute until it reaches the start, thereby creating the complete path.\n",

    "### A* Pathfinding Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The `A_star` function is the core of our path planning, implementing the A* search algorithm to find an optimal path from a start to a goal position on a grid-based map. Below, we provide a breakdown of how the algorithm operates:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of the Key Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization**:\n",
    "  - **Start and Goal Nodes**: The function begins by creating a start node (`START_NODE`) with `g = 0` (the cost to reach the start node is zero) and a goal node (`GOAL_NODE`).\n",
    "  - **Heuristic Calculation**: The heuristic (`h`) for the start node is computed using the `Heuristic_function`.\n",
    "  - **Data Structures**:\n",
    "    - **Open List** (`OPEN_list`): A priority queue that stores nodes yet to be explored, sorted based on their `f` value (total estimated cost).\n",
    "    - **Closed Set** (`CLOSED_set`): A set that tracks nodes that have already been explored.\n",
    "    - **Nodes Dictionary** (`nodes`): Tracks nodes that have already been visited, ensuring that if a node is revisited, the algorithm always uses the shortest known path to reach it rather than simply using the most recent path.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Environment Matrix Representation**:\n",
    "  - The **environment map** is represented as a matrix where:\n",
    "    - **`0`** indicates a **free path** that the algorithm can traverse.\n",
    "    - **`1`** indicates an **obstacle** that cannot be crossed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Search Loop**:\n",
    "  - The algorithm proceeds until the **open list** is empty. It repeatedly pops the node with the **lowest `f` value** from the open list.\n",
    "  - If the **current node** is already in the closed set, it is skipped to avoid redundant processing. Otherwise, it is added to the closed set for tracking purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal Check**:\n",
    "  - If the current node's position matches the goal, the function reconstructs the **optimal path** using the `reconstruct_path()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exploration of Neighboring Nodes**:\n",
    "  - **Moves**: The possible moves include 8 directions — vertical, horizontal, and diagonal.\n",
    "  - For each potential move:\n",
    "    - The **neighbor's position** is calculated, and checks are performed to ensure that it is within bounds and is not an obstacle.\n",
    "    - If the position is already in the closed set, it is skipped.\n",
    "    - The **movement cost** is calculated:\n",
    "      - **Vertical/Horizontal Movement Cost** = 1\n",
    "      - **Diagonal Movement Cost** = $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$\n",
    "  - The **tentative cost (`g_tentative`)** to reach the neighbor is computed by adding the movement cost to the `g` value of the current node.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Neighbor Node Handling**:\n",
    "  - If the neighbor node does not exist in the `nodes` dictionary, a **new node** is created.\n",
    "  - If the newly found path to the neighbor is **more efficient** than any previously known path (i.e., has a lower `g` value), the neighbor node's values are updated to reflect this improvement.\n",
    "  - The neighbor node is then added to the **open list** for future exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No Path Found**:\n",
    "  - If the **open list** is exhausted without reaching the goal, the function returns **`None`** and prints \"No path found.\""
